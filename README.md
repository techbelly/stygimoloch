Stygimoloch is a library providing an API - you can call it a DSL if you like - to write line-by-line textfile processing recipes.

It's inspired by - you might say ripped off from - Romily Cocking's java GetInLine library. http://sourceforge.net/projects/getinline

Not much to see here yet, so, move along.

I seem to be doing an awful lot of text-processing and data munging these days. Usually at the shell with my chums grep, awk and sed. But I need something that's a bit easier to abstract, and dare I say it, reuse.
